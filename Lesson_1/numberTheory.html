<b>Fundamental theorem of arithmetic. </b><br><br>
The crucial importance of prime numbers to number theory and mathematics in general<br> stems from the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, which states that<br><br>
every integer larger than 1 can be written as a product of one or more primes in a way that is unique except for the order of the prime factors.<br>[3] Primes can thus be considered the “basic building blocks” of the natural numbers. For example: 23244	= 2 · 2 · 3 · 13 · 149= 22 · 3 · 13 · 149. (22 denotes the square or second power of 2.) As in this example, the same prime factor may occur multiple times. A decomposition: n = p1 · p2 · ... · pt of a number n into (finitely many) prime factors p1, p2, ... to pt is called prime factorization of n.
